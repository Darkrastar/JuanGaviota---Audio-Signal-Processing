# JuanGaviota---Audio-Signal-Processing
This is a project developed to interpret and identify real sound waves (Analogs) and then create an identical sound from the identified wave (Fundamentals). Later, an application is created that detects a specific word in an audiobook.

Codigo-------It is the code of the project, it contains the logic for the transformation of the sound wave to mathematical language and 
             it contains the application that recognizes the specific word in an audiobook. 
Recursos-----Audios that were used for the transformations and the application

In the first part, we had 2 audios in different formats (MP3 and WAV) we had to introduce them to the code and later, find their mathematical form (sinosoid) and then form the same mathematical form, but clean. In the second part, the application aimed to collect all the forms of the word "Juan" and process it. When he had already saved them, they had to be compared in an audiobook and he had to show how many times the word "Juan" sounded.
